# CalNote

CalNote is a project that I started to improve my Android Development knowledge. Later on I have decided to make it public, open source and publish it on Play Store.

It uses [Firebase's](https://firebase.google.com) Authentication/Database/Storage libraries for it's implementation and several other libraries.

Make sure you read App's [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) and [Terms and Conditions](TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS.md) before using it.
